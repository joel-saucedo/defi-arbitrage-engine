# ethereum-mev-research

high-frequency arbitrage detection engine with sub-millisecond execution capabilities

## architecture

polyglot computational pipeline engineered for maximum-extractable-value opportunities across ethereum layer-2 ecosystems. core optimization focuses on latency reduction through assembly-level mathematical operations, parallel rust execution, and direct memory management.

### performance metrics

```
mempool-to-execution: <0.8ms average
