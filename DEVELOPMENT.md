# Development Guide

## Environment Setup

### System Requirements
- linux x86_64 with kernel 5.4+
- rust toolchain 1.75+ with nightly features
- go 1.21+ with module support
- python 3.10+ with development headers
- cmake 3.20+ and modern c++ compiler
- nasm assembler for mathematical primitives

### Installation Sequence
```bash
# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/joel-saucedo/ethereum-mev-research.git
cd ethereum-mev-research

# setup development environment
make setup

# compile all components
make build-all

# verify installation
make test
```

## Code Organization

### Module Structure
```
src/core/           # polyglot execution engine
├── rust_engine/    # high-performance computation core
├── asm_optimizations/ # hand-optimized mathematical operations
├── cpp_net/        # network layer with kernel bypass techniques
├── go_concurrent/  # parallel mempool processing
└── js_wasm/        # browser-compatible execution environment
```

### Component Integration
- python orchestrates polyglot execution pipeline
- rust handles computationally intensive arbitrage calculations
- assembly provides vectorized mathematical primitives
- c++ manages network connections with minimal latency
- go processes mempool transactions concurrently
- javascript enables browser-based strategy development

## Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy
```bash
# unit tests for individual components
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v

# integration tests across language boundaries
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v

# performance benchmarks
make benchmark
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# static analysis
make lint

# memory profiling
python -m memory_profiler src/algorithms/mev_detection.py

# performance profiling
py-spy record -o profile.svg -- python src/core/test_polyglot_integration.py
```

### Debugging Guidelines
- use rust debugging with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1`
- enable assembly debugging with `-g` flag in makefile
- c++ debugging with gdb and address sanitizer
- go race detection with `-race` flag
- python debugging with pdb and line_profiler

## Performance Optimization

### Critical Path Analysis
1. identify bottlenecks using profiling tools
2. optimize mathematical operations in assembly
3. parallelize independent calculations in rust
4. minimize memory allocations in hot paths
5. use zero-copy techniques for data transfer

### Memory Management
- pre-allocate buffers for known data sizes
- use memory pools for frequent allocations
- implement custom allocators for specific use cases
- minimize garbage collection pressure
- utilize stack allocation where possible

### Network Optimization
- maintain persistent connection pools
- implement backpressure handling
- use vectorized i/o operations
- minimize system call overhead
- implement custom protocol parsers

## Research Integration

### Mathematical Modeling
- implement algorithms from academic papers
- validate results against published benchmarks
- document mathematical foundations in code
- provide reference implementations
- maintain backward compatibility

### Protocol Analysis
- monitor protocol upgrades and changes
- implement new dex integrations
- analyze gas fee mechanisms
- research cross-chain arbitrage opportunities
- investigate privacy-preserving techniques

### Strategy Development
- backtest strategies against historical data
- implement risk management frameworks
- optimize for different market conditions
- analyze slippage and execution costs
- develop novel arbitrage detection methods

## Deployment Considerations

### Production Environment
- compile with release optimization flags

- conduct security audits of critical code

### Monitoring and Observability
- implement comprehensive logging
- setup performance metrics collection
- monitor memory usage and gc pressure
- track network latency and throughput
- setup alerting for anomalous behavior
