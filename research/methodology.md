### 2.3 Benchmarking Protocols

#### Synthetic Workload Generation
```python
# Pseudo-code for synthetic MEV opportunity generation
def generate_synthetic_opportunities():
    for i in range(TEST_ITERATIONS):
        # Generate realistic price differentials
        base_price = random.uniform(1000, 5000)  # USDC
        price_diff = random.normal(0, base_price * 0.002)  # 0.2% std dev
        
        # Create cross-exchange price scenario
        exchange_prices = {
            'uniswap': base_price,
            'sushiswap': base_price + price_diff,
            'balancer': base_price + random.normal(0, base_price * 0.001)
        }
        
        yield ArbitrageOpportunity(
            token_pair='ETH/USDC',
            prices=exchange_prices,
            liquidity=random.uniform(10000, 100000),
            timestamp=time.time_ns()
        )
```

```

## 3. Statistical Analysis Framework

### 3.1 Performance Metrics

#### Primary Metrics
- **Latency (μs)**: 50th, 95th, 99th, and 99.9th percentiles
- **Throughput (TPS)**: Sustained and peak transaction processing rates
- **Success Rate (%)**: Profitable MEV opportunities successfully captured
- **Profit Margin (%)**: Net profit after gas costs and slippage

#### Secondary Metrics
- **Memory Usage (MB)**: Peak and average memory consumption
- **CPU Utilization (%)**: Per-core usage during operation
- **Network Bandwidth (Mbps)**: Data transfer requirements
- **Energy Efficiency (J/op)**: Power consumption per operation

### 3.2 Statistical Methods

#### Confidence Intervals
```
For latency measurements with sample size n:
CI = x̄ ± t(α/2, n-1) × (s/√n)

Where:
- x̄ = sample mean
- t = t-distribution critical value
- s = sample standard deviation
- α = significance level (0.05 for 95% CI)
```

#### Hypothesis Testing
```
Null Hypothesis (H₀): μ_new ≥ μ_baseline
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): μ_new < μ_baseline

Test Statistic: t = (x̄_new - x̄_baseline) / SE_diff
Where SE_diff = √(s₁²/n₁ + s₂²/n₂)
```

### 3.3 Regression Analysis

#### Performance Modeling
```
Latency Model:
L(t) = β₀ + β₁×log(TPS) + β₂×CPU_util + β₃×Memory_usage + ε

Throughput Model:
TPS = α₀ + α₁×Cores + α₂×Memory_BW + α₃×Network_latency + δ
```
