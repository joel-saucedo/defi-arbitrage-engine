# defi-arbitrage-engine

defi arbitrage engine - computational trading research laboratory

## overview
experimental platform for mev extraction and arbitrage detection across decentralized exchanges. 
focus on algorithmic optimization, mathematical modeling, and web3 protocol analysis.

### core functionality
- multi-dex arbitrage scanning (uniswap v2/v3, sushiswap, balancer)
- graph theory pathfinding (dijkstra, genetic algorithms)  
- real-time mempool monitoring and tx analysis
- gas optimization and fee prediction models
- sandwich attack detection and protection
- yield farming strategy optimization

### research domains
- **amm mechanics**: constant product, stable swap, concentrated liquidity curves
- **tokenomics**: liquidity incentive modeling and game theory
- **computational methods**: graph algorithms, optimization theory, ml integration
- **mev strategies**: flashloan arbitrage, liquidation bots, priority auctions

### tech stack
- blockchain: web3.py, ethereum, polygon, arbitrum l2s
- algorithms: networkx, numpy, scipy, cvxpy for convex optimization
- machine learning: tensorflow/pytorch for price prediction models
- monitoring: websockets, asyncio, real-time data streams
- visualization: matplotlib, plotly for strategy backtesting

### experimental components
- genetic algorithm route optimization
- reinforcement learning for dynamic strategy adaptation
- zero-knowledge proof integration for private arbitrage
- cross-chain bridge vulnerability analysis
- automated market maker curve research
